## 💾 Supabase Free Tier Impact

### **Database Usage:**
```sql
-- New table: user_strava_verifications
-- Estimated storage per user: ~500 bytes
-- 1000 verified users = ~500KB storage
```

**Storage Impact:**
- **Minimal:** Each verification record is small
- **One-time:** User connects once, data persists
- **Efficient:** Only stores essential verification data

### **API Calls:**
- **User connects:** 3-4 database operations (one-time)
- **Profile views:** 1 read operation per page load
- **Token refresh:** 1 update operation (automatic, rare)
- **Badge display:** 1 read operation per listing view

### **Free Tier Limits (Monthly):**
- **Database rows:** 500,000 (you'll use ~1,000-5,000)
- **Storage:** 500MB (Strava data uses ~1-5MB)
- **API requests:** 50,000 (Strava features use minimal calls)

**🎯 Impact: NEGLIGIBLE** - Strava integration will barely affect your free tier usage.
